# Chat Sidebar Notifications & Sorting Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ **Infinite Loop Error** (CRITICAL)
**Error:** `Maximum update depth exceeded`

**Root Cause:**
The `selectChat` function in `ChatContext.js` was checking if a chat exists in the `chats` array and calling `loadChats()` if it didn't. However, the function wasn't including `chats` or `loadChats` in its dependency array, causing React to think the function was stable when it wasn't. This created an infinite loop:
1. Click chat → selectChat runs
2. Chat not found → loadChats called
3. Chats updated → selectChat recreated
4. Click chat → infinite loop starts

**Fix:**
Removed the unnecessary chat existence check from `selectChat`. The API call will handle missing chats appropriately, and we don't need to pre-check the local state.

```javascript
// BEFORE (Caused infinite loop)
const selectChat = useCallback(async (chatId) => {
  const existingChat = chats.find(chat => chat.id === chatId);
  if (!existingChat) {
    await loadChats(); // This caused the infinite loop
  }
  // ... rest of code
}, []); // Missing dependencies!

// AFTER (Fixed)
const selectChat = useCallback(async (chatId) => {
  // Directly fetch the chat from API
  const response = await axios.get(`${API}/chats/${chatId}`, { headers });
  // ... rest of code
}, []); // No external dependencies needed
```

### 2. ✅ **"New" Label Showing Incorrectly**

**Problem:**
The "New" label was showing for all unassigned chats with unread messages, even after you started a conversation. This was confusing because a chat shouldn't be marked as "New" once you've interacted with it.

**Fix:**
Removed the "New" label entirely and rely only on the unread count badge, which is more accurate and less confusing.

```javascript
// BEFORE
{chat.status === 'unassigned' && chat.unread_count > 0 && (
  <span className="px-2 py-0.5 bg-orange-500/20 text-orange-400 text-xs rounded-full">
    New
  </span>
)}
{chat.unread_count > 0 && (
  <span className="px-2 py-0.5 bg-purple-500 text-white text-xs rounded-full">
    {chat.unread_count}
  </span>
)}

// AFTER (Simplified and clearer)
{chat.unread_count > 0 && (
  <span className="px-2 py-0.5 bg-purple-500 text-white text-xs font-semibold rounded-full">
    {chat.unread_count}
  </span>
)}
```

### 3. ✅ **Chat Sorting - New Messages Move to Top**

**Already Working!**
The existing code already implements this feature correctly:

```javascript
const sortChatsByRecency = (chatList = []) =>
  [...chatList].sort((a, b) => getChatActivityTime(b) - getChatActivityTime(a));
```

When new messages arrive:
1. `updateChatMessages` is called
2. The function updates the `last_message_timestamp`
3. `sortChatsByRecency` is called to re-sort the list
4. Chat with new message moves to top

---

### 4. ✅ **Total Unread Count Badge**

**Already Implemented!**
The sidebar header already shows the total unread count:

```javascript
const totalUnread = useMemo(
  () => chats.reduce((count, chat) => count + (chat.unread_count || 0), 0),
  [chats]
);

// In the header:
{totalUnread > 0 && (
  <span className="px-2 py-0.5 bg-purple-500 text-xs font-semibold text-white rounded-full">
    {totalUnread}
  </span>
)}
```

### 5. ✨ **Visual Improvements**

Added CSS styling to make unread chats stand out more:

**New Styles in `ChatWindow.css`:**

1. **Chat Item States:**
   - Default: Transparent background
   - Hover: Slight purple tint
   - Active (selected): Purple background with left border
   - Has Unread: Subtle purple background with purple left border

2. **Unread Badge Animation:**
   - Unread badges now have a subtle pulse animation
   - Makes new messages more noticeable

```css
.chat-item.has-unread {
  background-color: rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.05);
  border-left: 3px solid #a78bfa;
}

@keyframes pulse {
  0%, 100% { opacity: 1; }
  50% { opacity: 0.7; }
}

.chat-item.has-unread .badge {
  animation: pulse 2s ease-in-out infinite;
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Message Flow:

1. **New Message Arrives (WebSocket)**
   ```
   Backend → WebSocket → handleWebSocketMessage → updateChatMessages
   ```

2. **Chat List Updated**
   - Unread count incremented (if not the active chat)
   - Last message timestamp updated
   - List automatically re-sorted
   - Chat with new message moves to top

3. **Visual Updates**
   - Unread badge appears with count
   - Chat gets purple left border
   - Total unread count in header updates
   - Badge pulses to draw attention

4. **User Clicks Chat**
   - `selectChat` called
   - Messages fetched from API
   - Marked as read on backend
   - Unread count reset to 0
   - Visual indicators removed
