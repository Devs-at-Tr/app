Frontend .env file (REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL) is configured to connect to http://localhost:8000, but the backend service is running on port 8001 (as configured in supervisor). This causes all API calls to fail with ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED. The frontend UI is fully implemented with proper components, routing, and data-testid attributes for testing. Login page renders correctly, but authentication cannot complete. All dashboard features (stats cards, chat management, platform selector, templates, comments) are implemented but cannot be tested until the backend connection is established. SOLUTION NEEDED: Either (1) configure a proxy/nginx to route port 8000 to 8001, or (2) update frontend/.env to use port 8001, or (3) change backend to run on port 8000."
