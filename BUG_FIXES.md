# Bug Fixes - Template & Mobile Implementation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. React Hooks Error in ChatWindow

**Error Message:**
```
ERROR: Rendered more hooks than during the previous render.
at useMediaQuery → useIsMobile → ChatWindow
```

**Root Cause:**
The `useIsMobile()` hook was being called **after** a conditional return statement in the ChatWindow component. React hooks must always be called in the same order and at the top level of the component, before any conditional logic.

**Location:** `frontend/src/components/ChatWindow.js`

**Fix:**
Moved `const isMobile = useIsMobile()` to the top of the component, right after the `useChatContext()` call and before any conditional returns.

```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - Hook called after conditional return
const ChatWindow = ({ agents, userRole, onAssignChat }) => {
  const { selectedChat: chat, sendMessage } = useChatContext();
  // ... other state
  
  if (!chat) {
    return <div>...</div>; // Early return
  }
  
  const isMobile = useIsMobile(); // ❌ Hook called conditionally!
  // ...
}

// ✅ CORRECT - Hook called at top level
const ChatWindow = ({ agents, userRole, onAssignChat }) => {
  const { selectedChat: chat, sendMessage } = useChatContext();
  const isMobile = useIsMobile(); // ✅ Called before any returns
  // ... other state
  
  if (!chat) {
    return <div>...</div>; // Early return is fine now
  }
  // ...
}
```

### 2. Missing `/api/chats/{chat_id}/mark_read` Endpoint

**Error Message:**
```
INFO: 202.179.95.73:0 - "POST /api/chats/689250d4-c36c-469f-9de0-9a614f720fb6/mark_read HTTP/1.1" 404 Not Found
```

**Root Cause:**
The frontend `ChatContext.js` was calling `/api/chats/{chat_id}/mark_read` endpoint to reset unread count when a chat is selected, but this endpoint didn't exist in the backend.

**Location:** `backend/server.py`

**Fix:**
Added the missing endpoint after the `/chats/{chat_id}/assign` endpoint:

```python
@api_router.post("/chats/{chat_id}/mark_read")
def mark_chat_as_read(chat_id: str, current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user), db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    """Mark a chat as read by resetting unread count"""
    chat = db.query(Chat).filter(Chat.id == chat_id).first()
    if not chat:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Chat not found")
    
    # Check access - agents can only mark their assigned chats, admins can mark any
    if current_user.role == UserRole.AGENT and chat.assigned_to != current_user.id:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Access denied")
    
    # Reset unread count
    chat.unread_count = 0
    db.commit()
    
    logger.info(f"Chat {chat_id} marked as read by user {current_user.id}")
    return {"success": True, "chat_id": chat_id}
```

**Features:**
- Resets `unread_count` to 0 for the specified chat
- Access control: Agents can only mark their assigned chats, admins can mark any
- Returns success response with chat_id
- Logs the action for audit trail

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/src/components/ChatWindow.js`
   - Moved `useIsMobile()` hook to top level

2. `backend/server.py`
   - Added `/api/chats/{chat_id}/mark_read` POST endpoint

---

## Testing

### Test React Hooks Fix
1. Start frontend: `npm start`
2. Login as admin or agent
3. Click on "Chats" tab
4. Select any chat
5. ✅ Should load without "Rendered more hooks" error

### Test Mark Read Endpoint
1. Start backend: `python server.py`
2. Select a chat with unread messages
3. Check browser Network tab for `/mark_read` API call
4. ✅ Should return 200 OK (not 404)
5. ✅ Unread count badge should disappear

---

## Status

✅ **Both issues resolved!**

The application should now:
- Load chats without React hooks errors
- Properly mark chats as read when selected
- Display correct unread counts
- Work seamlessly on mobile and desktop

---

## Notes

### Why Hook Order Matters

React relies on the order of hook calls to maintain state between renders. If hooks are called conditionally, the order can change, causing React to throw errors. Always call hooks at the top level of your component.

**Reference:** [React Hooks Rules](https://react.dev/reference/rules/rules-of-hooks)

### WebSocket Disconnect

The WebSocket disconnect message in your logs is normal:
```
INFO: WebSocket disconnected for user be6dc0ab-313f-4b73-99a8-934e4ec8b25f
INFO: connection closed
```

This happens when:
- User switches pages
- Browser tab closes
- Network connection is lost
- Component unmounts

The WebSocket will automatically reconnect when needed. This is expected behavior and not an error.
